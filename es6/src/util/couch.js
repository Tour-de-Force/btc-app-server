// ## Couch Utilities
// This file provides utilities for working with CouchDB and PouchDB. The
// goal is to keep model code unaware of connection details. We are not able
// to separate PouchDB Sync options from the model code, however.

import PouchDB from 'pouchdb';
import { sync } from 'backbone-pouch';
import nano from 'nano';
import config from 'config';

const {protocol, domain, port, username, password} = config.get( 'couch' );

export const root = `${protocol}://${domain}:${port}`;

// Export a nano driver on the CouchDB database, useful for dealing with
// users and authentication.
export const nano_db = nano( root );

// Connect multiple Backbone classes (Models and Collections) to the database.
//
//  * In production, `database` is appended to CouchDB's root url
//  * In test, `database` is used as the name of a local database
export function connect( database, ...klasses ) {
  let url;
  if ( process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' ) {
    url = database;
  } else {
